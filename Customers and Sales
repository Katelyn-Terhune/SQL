In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Product='iPhone';

SELECT * FROM customers limit 20 

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
on cust.order_id=FEB.orderid 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan LIMIT 10

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?


SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price)
From BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 

GROUP BY product 

~~didnt need but could need.~~


~or~
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1; 


5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 

SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, Product 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales as JAN
where Product <> 'Product'
AND length(Product) > 1
Group by Product


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FEBSales FEB LIMIT 20
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers cust LIMIT 20

6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?


SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, Product , Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FEBSales FEB
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND Product <> 'Product'
AND length(Product) > 1
Group by Product


7.How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 


SELECT Count(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(price*Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FEBSales as feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id 
where feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
